Since that’s quite the mouthful, it’s usually just called the humuhumu for short. The name means ‘fish with a snout like a pig’ and it makes sense considering the large snout of this fish. Both males and females guard territories, with some maintaining a territory for over eight years! They typically form harems during breeding, with one male guarding several females.",

The coral polyps tend to retract during the day, which gives these corals the alternative name of ‘broccoli’, because of their resemblance to the vegetable. The coral is largely nocturnal and the polyps emerge at night to feed,  resembling small flowers at the ends of the branches.  As a soft coral, this species does not produce a hard calcium carbonate skeleton like many other corals.

          "longDescription": "This Cnidarian is related to anemones and jellyfish and has particularly potent stinging cells , called cnidocytes, at the end of its tentacles.  It is named after the torch like appearance of these tentacles, since the cnidocytes are in a bulb-like shape. Their ability to sting is primarily used in defence. Torch corals are also popular in hobbyist tanks, and around 33,000 individual corals were exported from Indonesia and Fiji in 2005. This demand for the pet trade is partly why the torch coral is classified as ‘Near Threatened’ by the IUCN. However, they are also threatened by climate change as, like other corals, they are sensitive to changes in the acidity and temperature of water. \n",

The snails can grow up to 30 cm (12 inches) in length, with a spiral-shaped shell that is typically light brown with darker bands. They are herbivorous, feeding on a wide variety of plant material, and are most active during the rainy season when moisture levels are higher.",

A single female can lay hundreds of eggs in one go, and they can reach sexual maturity in just a few months, which has contributed to their spread in non-native areas. Despite their size and invasive nature, they are often kept as exotic pets, and their slow, gentle movements make them popular for observation in terrariums.",

The Brazilian Salmon Pink Birdeater has a characteristic dark brown or black body with bright pink or orange hairs on its legs and abdomen, giving it a striking appearance. Despite its intimidating size, this species is typically docile and slow-moving but can be defensive if threatened.",

          "funFact": "Despite its name, the Brazilian Salmon Pink Birdeater doesn't actually eat birds in the wild. The \"birdeater\" part of its name comes from early reports, but in reality, these tarantulas primarily feed on insects, small reptiles, and amphibians. They are also known for their impressive ability to flick urticating hairs from their abdomen as a defense mechanism if they feel threatened.",

Zebra species differ in social behaviour, with plains and mountain zebra living in stable harems consisting of an adult male or stallion, several adult females or mares, and their young or foals; while Grévy's zebra live alone or in loosely associated herds. In harem-holding species, adult females mate only with their harem stallion, while male Grévy's zebras establish territories which attract females and the species is promiscuous. Zebras communicate with various vocalisations, body postures and facial expressions. Social grooming strengthens social bonds in plains and mountain zebras.",

Males engage in 'necking' battles to establish dominance, swinging their necks and heads at each other. Despite their large size, giraffes can run up to 35 mph in short bursts.
