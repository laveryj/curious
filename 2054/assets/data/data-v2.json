            "longDescription": "The idea of collecting a picture of a famous doctor seems strange today but that was the purpose of this print produced in 1840 and available for purchase by subscription. Doctors, like Henry Jephson, cemented their reputation as learned gentleman doctors through images like this, something that was vital to attract new patients and maintain their medical practice. By this period, Jephson was renowned in Leamington for his treatments using saline water and had an average annual income of around £1 million in today’s money. He further secured his status through philanthropic projects in the town.",
