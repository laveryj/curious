    <h2>Welcome to Curious</h2>
    <p>
      Curious is a interactive digital interpretation system specifically designed for zoos and aquariums. Our platform empowers your visitors to discover detailed information about animals in your exhibits using their own smartphones by scanning QR codes or tapping NFC tags. It's simple to set up, easy to use, and low-cost.
    </p>

    <h2>How Does It Work?</h2>
    <p>
      Curious bridges the gap between curiosity and knowledge. Visitors scan a QR code or tap an NFC tag at an exhibit to unlock a treasure trove of information. Each page provides:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Detailed species profiles that include images and scientific data.</li>
      <li>Fascinating fun facts, up-to-date conservation status, and rich images.</li>
      <li>Optional audio-only mode to create a quick and easy audio guide for your site.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      There's no need for app downloads – it works seamlessly on any modern smartphone using the built-in web browser.
    </p>

    <h2>Experience Curious for Yourself</h2>
    <p>
      Our sample test site is a great way to see how it all works. Use your phone to scan the QR code below, and explore our sample "Ocean Tank" exhibit. Dive into the species profiles and learn more about the animals within the tank.
